Introduction
============

This repository is where I keep Asymptote_ code that is generic and useful
enough to be made into a module.

.. _Asymptote: http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/


The modules
===========

Currently this repository contains only one module. This might change as my
knowledge of ``Asymptote`` increases.


dims
----

This module provides simple horizontal and vertical measurements. It tries to
be simpler than the ``CAD`` module that comes with ``Asymptote``.
